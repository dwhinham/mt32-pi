#
# A single stereo frame of audio has two samples, and so this value is double

# The smaller the chunk size, the lower the latency, but too low a value will

# Latency is a function of chunk size and sample rate, for example:
# 256 samples / 2 channels / 48000Hz * 1000ms = 2.67ms of latency.
# See documentation for recommended values for various Raspberry Pi models.
#
# The minimum value varies depending on audio output device.

# SoundFont synthesizer options

# to use on startup.
#
# On startup, the "soundfonts" directory is scanned for valid SoundFonts, which
# are added to a list and sorted into alphabetical order.
#
# This setting is a zero-indexed offset into that list (i.e. 0 is the first,
# 1, is the second, and so on).

# If the index specified is unavailable, the first available SoundFont will be
# used.
#
# Values: 0-255 (0*)

# Set the master volume gain.
#
# The default is a low value to avoid clipping when many notes are playing at

# range will be clamped.
#
# Values: 0.0-10.0 (0.2*)
gain = 0.2

# Set the maximum number of voices that can be played simultaneously.
#
# Depending on the complexity of your SoundFont, you may need to reduce this
# value to prevent audio buffer underruns (distortion) when playing music
# featuring lots of notes being played at once.
#
# On the other hand, Raspberry Pi 4 users may want to try raising this value as
# it has a more powerful CPU.
#
# N.B. larger file size of the SoundFont does not imply higher CPU usage.
# SoundFonts that use more real-time effects (modulators) are more likely to
# require a reduction in polyphony.
