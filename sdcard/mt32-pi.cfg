[system]

# Set the default synthesizer to be made active on startup.

# If the default synthesizer is unavilable (e.g. missing ROMs or SoundFonts),
# the first working synth is made active.

# Values: mt32*, soundfont
#
# mt32:      Use mt32emu (Munt) for Roland MT-32 emulation
# soundfont: Use FluidSynth for SoundFont synthesis
default_synth = mt32

# Set the I2C baud rate/clock speed for all peripherals (Hz).
#
# Most peripherals will work fine at the default speed (400KHz "fast mode"),
# but larger LCD/OLED displays (e.g. 4-line I2C HD44780 and 64 pixel high
# SSD1306) won't be able to refresh at 60FPS at the default setting.
#
# Try increasing this value to 1000000 (1MHz) for a smoother LCD refresh rate.
# If your display doesn't work, try backing off the speed 100KHz at a time
# until it does.
#
# Values: 100000-1000000 (400000*)

# Set the timout for power saving mode (seconds).
#
# After the specified number of seconds of silence, the CPU clock speed will be
# reduced, the audio device will be stopped, and and the LCD's backlight will
# be turned off to save energy (certain I2C displays only).
#
# Any MIDI activity will instantly bring the system out of power saving mode.
#
# If set to 0, power saving mode is disabled.

# Values: on*, off
usb = on

# Set the baud rate used for GPIO MIDI.
#
# For connecting to standard MIDI devices (i.e. via DIN cable), this should be
# left at the default rate of 31250.
#
# For connecting to PCs, set this to match the baud rate of the other host.
# SoftMPU's serial MIDI mode, for example, uses a baud rate of 38400.

# Enable or disable software "MIDI thru" on the GPIO Tx pin.

# Sample rate of audio output (Hz).
#
# mt32emu uses an internal sample rate of 32000Hz (just like the real hardware)
# which is then resampled to this value.
#
# FluidSynth renders at this sample rate directly.
#
# Values: 32000-192000 (48000*)
sample_rate = 48000

# Set audio rendering chunk size (samples).
#
# A single stereo frame of audio has two samples, and so this value is double
# the number of frames per chunk.
# The smaller the chunk size, the lower the latency, but too low a value will
# cause underruns (distortion artifacts).
#
# Latency is a function of chunk size and sample rate, for example:
# 256 samples / 2 channels / 48000Hz * 1000ms = 2.67ms of latency.
# See documentation for recommended values for various Raspberry Pi models.
#
# The minimum value varies depending on audio output device.
# For PWM, the minimum is 2, for I2S the minimum is 32.
#
# Values: 2-2048 (256*)
chunk_size = 256

# Set address (hexadecimal) of I2C DAC control interface.
#
# This will be used for the initialization sequence (see below) if enabled.
# You can find the address of your DAC by using the i2cdetect utility in Linux.
#
# Values: 00-80 (4c*)
i2c_dac_address = 4c

# Select an initialization sequence for the DAC.
#
# Some DACs require some initialization commands to be sent via I2C before they
# will produce any sound.

# the MiSTer's on-screen display.

# MT-32 emulator options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[mt32emu]

# Select quality level for the resampler.
#
# If set to none, audio output will sound wrong unless you set the sample rate
# option to 32000Hz, which is the MT-32's native sample rate.
#
# Values: none, fastest, fast, good*, best
resampler_quality = good

# Select initial MIDI channel assignment.
#
# The MT-32 uses an unusual MIDI channel assignment by default. On a real MT-32
# this is set using a button combination. Use this option to change the initial
# channel assignment on startup.
#
# Values: standard*, alternate
#
# standard:  Parts 1-8 = MIDI channels 2-9, Rhythm part = MIDI channel 10
# alternate: Parts 1-8 = MIDI channels 1-8, Rhythm part = MIDI channel 10
midi_channels = standard

# Select initial ROM set to use.
#
# If multiple ROM sets are available, this option determines which set to use
# on startup. If the ROM set specified here is unavailable, the first available
# set is used instead.

# Values: old*, new, cm32l

# SoundFont synthesizer options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[fluidsynth]

# Set the initial SoundFont to use.
#
# If multiple SoundFonts are available, this option determines which SoundFont
# to use on startup.
#
# On startup, the "soundfonts" directory is scanned for valid SoundFonts, which
# are added to a list and sorted into alphabetical order.
#
# This setting is a zero-indexed offset into that list (i.e. 0 is the first,
# 1, is the second, and so on).
#
# If the index specified is unavailable, the first available SoundFont will be
# used.
#
# Values: 0-255 (0*)
soundfont = 0

# Set the maximum number of voices that can be played simultaneously.
#
# Depending on the complexity of your SoundFont, you may need to reduce this
# value to prevent audio buffer underruns (distortion) when playing music
# featuring lots of notes being played at once.
#
# On the other hand, Raspberry Pi 4 users may want to try raising this value as
# it has a more powerful CPU.
#
# N.B. larger file size of the SoundFont does not imply higher CPU usage.
# SoundFonts that use more real-time effects (modulators) are more likely to
# require a reduction in polyphony.
#
# Values: 1-65535 (256*)

# Values: none*, hd44780_4bit, hd44780_i2c, ssd1306_i2c

# Set the height of the LCD.
#
# Same characters vs. pixels considerations as for width.
